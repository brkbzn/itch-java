Java library for NASDAQ ITCH (SoupBinTCP) protocol

Summary
=======

This is an academic project, it attempts to clearly show ITCH 4.1 and SoupBin work.

Grab a data file from ftp://emi.nasdaq.com/ITCH/ and load it up as a FileSource to check it out. You will need one of the [datestamp].NASDAQ_ITCH41 files. The others are different protocol formats and probably will not work.
